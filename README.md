This project delves into designing a compact, open-source System on Chip (SoC) based on RVMYTH, a RISC-V-based processor core. The SoC integrates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for precise clock generation and control, alongside a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for interfacing with external analog systems. By converting digital signals into analog, this DAC allows BabySoC to communicate with devices that accept analog inputs, such as televisions and mobile phones, enabling output in the form of audio or video. Ultimately, this Sky130-technology-based SoC aims to provide a highly documented, educational platform for learning and experimentation in digital-analog interfacing.

1. Understanding System on a Chip (SoC)
2. Types of SoCs
3. Introduction to VSDBabySoC
This document outlines the structure and components of BabySoC, along with a basic understanding of SoCs and their types. By mastering these concepts and understanding how BabySoC operates, one gains a solid foundation in modern embedded systems design and digital-to-analog interfacing.
